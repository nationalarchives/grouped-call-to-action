# Grouped call to action

The design challenge here has three main components:

1. Accommodating a 'What to expect...' guide and TIFY image viewer link to a page that is already 'busy'
2. Exploring whether grouping information about accessing the record will make things easier to understand
3. Trying to identify a placement for information about accessing the record which balances the needs of:
    * promoting download as the primary CTA
    * users that would benefit from being presented with other parts of the details page (record description, heirarchy etc.) in order to decided if this is a record they'd like to see
    * those users that simply need the ways of access on arrival on the page
